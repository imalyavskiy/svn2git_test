TODO:
    * Create an entity which will form correct paths depending on the operating system we are running
       See svn_2git_adapter.py:create_root_subfolder
    * In case if path to save the working copy starts with ~\ on linux - we are crashing
       Replace ~ with \home\<username>
	* Create config functionality: if "create config" option is set - create config with parameters present
	   in the command line. If parameters are absent then existent parameters values must be blank("")
	* Parse "git svn clone..." log and report errors and/or warnings in addition to saving the log to a file
	* Parse "git submodule..." log and report errors and/or warnings
	* Authorization handling
	* Duplicate the console output of git and svn while they are working

DONE:
    * On Linux in order to run "git svn..." it is required to install additional package - "git-svn"
        Investigate how to deal with its absence
        == An addition check was added in case of "posix" OS
