TODO:
    * Create an entity which will form correct paths depending on the operating system we are running
      See svn_2git_adapter.py:create_root_subfolder
    * In case if path to save the working copy starts with ~\ on linux - we are crashing
    * On Linux in order to run "git svn..." it is required to install additional package - "git-svn"
      Investigate how to deal with its absence
	* Create config funcionality: if "create config" option is set - create config with paramenters present
	  in the comand line. If parameters are absent then existent parameters values must be blank("")
